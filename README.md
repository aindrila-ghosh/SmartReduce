**Dimensionality reduction (DR)** is a commonly used technique in big data analytics. Reducing the dimensionality of datasets not only helps with managing their analytical complexity but also with removing redundancy within them. Over the years, several DR algorithms have been proposed that approach the problem differently. With the same overall goal of preserving the original data structure, these algorithms attempt a linear or a nonlinear transformation on the data, based on the local or global spatial relationships in the dataset. Given a plethora of dimensionality reduction algorithms, there is a long existing need for guidelines on; **How to choose the most appropriate DR algorithm in a given scenario?** In order to bridge this gap, in this research we present an automated comparison among 15 DR algorithms and compare their performances across 13 state-of-the-art contextual metrics. Furthermore, we allow for a statistical significance analysis of the obtained results to assess the generalizability of the performances of these algorithms.
